title: Kopimists Stand For Idaho Teachers and Students
---

The core belief around kopimism is sharing information, to spread knoweldge is in our world the most powerful thing you can do. When we watch schools move more and more to standardized testing, especially with Common Core, we feel pain in our hearts.

Standardized tests are an attack on knowelege, it's not how humans learn and it's not an efficent way for us to display what we have learned. Not only that but law makers have the adacity to suggest that we tie our teachers already low salary to this aweful practice, which rids us of the good teachers who want to teach kids in fun and exciting ways the knoweldge for them to succeed and instead forces them to teach like robots... to teach to the test.

It's not the job of a teacher to teach for a test, it's the job of a teacher to teach for the future. Life isn't about neatly filled in boxes, a boss is never going to test their workers by having them fill in bubble sheets neatly with #2 pencils. It's about practical applied use of skills and knoweldge gained, it's about creative problem solving so that we can live and work more efficently. Students need those skills to be productive and valued members of our society, and yet some guy in a suit who went to law school thinks he knows what these kids need better than the ones who work with them daily.

So we have a novel thought: let's let teachers teach. Let the English teacher open a child's mind and see the wonder in books and make an admitedly boring book like Moby Dick new life... or better yet, let them provide more engaging books that will make students realize they love reading. Let's make math more than just using a book and finding half the answers in the back of it... let those math teachers show examples of the golden ratio, spend time making a diarama if that's what it takes so that the student *knows* what the golden ratio is, instead of just being able to recite a formula. Let teachers teach HOW to learn, so that when a students short time in school is over, they can go on and find new skills on their own and know how to dig deeper into the topics they love.

As of today, the Kopimist Chuch officially bans our members from taking or issuing standardized tests.
