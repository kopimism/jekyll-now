“Near-term national benefits are valued at [roughly] US$250 billion (140
billion to 1,050 billion) per year, which is likely to exceed implementation
costs,” the authors explained. “Including longer-term, worldwide climate
impacts, benefits roughly quintuple, becoming [about] 5-10 times larger than
estimated implementation costs.”

Taking into account increased worker productivity and reduced medical spending
due to lower levels of pollutants and harmful particulates, the study
estimates the economic impact could be even higher.

By 2030, the study estimates, energy policy changes could prevent about
175,000 premature deaths. Clean transportation could prevent an additional
120,000 premature deaths.

“Although costs might increase as reductions deepen,” the study explains,
“this suggests that, at least for the first half of the energy sector
emissions reductions, the net societal benefits are roughly 20 to 80 times the
implementation costs.”

Do you think the societal benefits are worth the costs? Do you think the
currently planned emission reductions are enough? Comment below or tweet
