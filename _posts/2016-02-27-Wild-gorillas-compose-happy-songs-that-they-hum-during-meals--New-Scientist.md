Song of the jungle

Bernd Rohrschneider/FLPA

Gorillas sing and hum when eating, a discovery that could help shed light on
how language evolved in early humans.

Singing seems to be a way for gorillas to express contentment with their meal,
as well as for the head of the family to communicate to others that it is
dinner time.

Food-related calls have been documented in many animals, including chimpanzees
and bonobos, but aside from anecdotal reports from zoos, there was no evidence
of it in gorillas.

To see if they make these noises in the wild, [Eva
Luef](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eva_Luef), a primatologist at the
Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Seewiesen, Germany, observed two
groups of wild western lowland gorillas in the Republic of the Congo.

Luef identified two different types of sound that the gorillas sometimes made
when eating. One of them was humming – [a steady low-frequency
tone](https://www.newscientist.com/article/giraffes-spend-their-evenings-
humming-to-each-other/) that sounds a bit like a sigh of contentment (listen
to clip below).

The other was singing – a series of short, differently pitched notes that
sounds a little like someone humming a random melody (listen to clip below).

“They don’t sing the same song over and over,” says Luef. “It seems like they
are [composing their little food
songs](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28265-zoologger-dj-frogs-sing-
like-birds-remixing-tunes-on-the-hop/).”

  

[Ali Vella-Irving](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ali-vella-irving-64967835), who
looks after gorillas at Toronto Zoo in Canada, says humming and singing is a
frequent part of mealtimes there. “Each gorilla has its own voice: you can
really tell who’s singing,” she says. “And if it’s their favourite food, they
sing louder.”

## Singing for supper

But although every individual in the zoo sings for its supper, Luef found that
in the wild it was generally only dominant silverback males that sang and
hummed while eating.

This suggests that as well as possibly signalling contentment or pleasure with
the food – a sort of gorilla version of “om nom nom” – the activity might be
the silverback’s way of informing the group that mealtime is continuing and it
is not yet time to move on. “He’s the one making the collective decisions for
the group,” Luef says. “We think he uses this vocalisation to inform the
others ‘OK, now we’re eating’.”

[Zanna Clay](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/clay-
zanna.aspx), a psychologist at the University of Birmingham in the UK, who has
studied communication in bonobos, says it is interesting how food calls in
different species reflect the different social structures of the great apes.

“We think food calls are a very social signal; it’s about coordinating feeding
events with others,” she says. “So in gorillas you get the dominant male
producing the calls, because he has to keep hold of all the females in his
group.”

In the much more fluid chimpanzee and bonobo societies, in which individuals
constantly make decisions about who they want to hang out with, [they all get
involved](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11756-bonobos-and-chimps-
speak-with-gestures/) in dinner-time conversations.

Because there is so much variation in calls both between individuals and
species, food calls provide a good way to study the [origin of
language](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21152-baby-apes-arm-waving-
hints-at-origins-of-language/), says Clay. “It gives a [good insight into the
origin of meaning in animal
signals](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24414-chimp-calls-suggest-
language-evolved-from-a-song/), and also the social pressures that might drive
the flexibility we see in language,” she says.
