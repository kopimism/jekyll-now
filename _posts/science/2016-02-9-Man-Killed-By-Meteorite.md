On Saturday, a falling meteorite is thought to have killed V. Kamaraj, a bus driver at Bharathidasan Engineering College in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

A four-foot crater is under investigation near the campus cafeteria (image above). Three others were also injured. According to NASA, there's no other documentation â€œin modern times of any person being killed by a meteorite." Indian Institute of Astrophysics scientists are examining debris to determine if that's what happened here.

The Indian government will provide 100,000 rupees ($1,473) to Kamari's family and 25,000 rupees to the other victims.
