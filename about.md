Everything is a copy and remix, your DNA, culture, even the solar system and possibly the universe. Kopimists embrace this, and embrace sharing knowledge. We base our belief system on science, and when we are wrong we admit we are wrong and move on. The highest truth is truth.

### More Information

The Kopimist Church is the education and evangelical arm of our recognized religion "Kopimism". Kopimism is fundamentally the belief that everything from the beginning of time has been shared, remixed, and copied to create the world we live in today. Atoms would bind to form molecules which would bind to form complex structures and eventually through these remixes the ability to store and share information was created and we developed more and more complex ways of sharing information.

We are made from the same material that we see in all the stars above us at night, everything around us is a remix of not only our parents and our relatively small history on Earth but also of what came billions of years before us. We honour that by seeking out new information, sharing all knowledge, and remixing and sharing the culture that has come before us and that is around us today.

<li>Copying of information is ethically right.</li>
<li>Dissemination of information is ethically right.</li>
<li><em>Copymixing</em> is a sacred kind of copying, moreso than the perfect, digital copying, because it expands and enhances the existing wealth of information</li>
<li>Copying or remixing information communicated by another person is seen as an act of respect and a strong expression of acceptance and Kopimistic faith.</li>
<li>The internet is holy.</li>
</ol>

Members of Kopimism (Kopimists) and Church of Kopimism recognized religious representatives (Operators) dedicate their lives to living in accordance with these axioms. The only correct way for a Kopimist to list is through the sanctification of these religious foundations.

### Become an Op

An "Op" is our term for religous leader (think pastor, rabbi, etc), though we also use the word "Reverend" to avoid religious percicution from people who don't accept any religion that's built on principals other than those found in the old remixed texts of their religion (also sometimes "Reverend" is the only prefix we can find in web forms so that's what we have chosen). 

If you identify with Kopimism, and you wan to evangelize the movement we have room for you. Please email [teamcoltra@gmail.com](mailto:teamcoltra@gmail.com) with your name and city (and location if not in Idaho) and we will have you officially listed on this page.
