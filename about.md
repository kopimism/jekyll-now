Everything is a copy and remix, your DNA, culture, even the solar system and possibly the universe. Kopimists embrace this, and embrace sharing knowledge. We base our belief system on science, and when we are wrong we admit we are wrong and move on. The highest truth is truth. 

### More Information

From all at one and from one to all – and then back – exchange without beginning and without end. Everything to everyone’s delight, and everybody’s joy of it all. No privileges, no exclusions – everywhere. Every believer has all knowledge – all knowledge is spread by every believer to all people without exception. Start the exponential cascade.

Our opponents, those who seek to censor, control, and limit the internet, do so because the Internet is communication and communication is spreading knowledge. An open, unfettered internet is a threat to these individuals, who prefer to stand between creators, content, and its distribution. We love the internet, but they seek to close it, and may succeed in this goal incrementally throughout the next several years. All believers should consider their ability to find other ways than the existing internet to copy and distribute. All means other than violence and destruction of physical property are allowed.

The message is spreading as it should – through the autonomous, the sovereign, through both individuals and groups.

Kopimism is based on a few basic axioms, which in turn can be traced back back to our strong defense of the intrinsic value of information, We ascribe this value to all information irrespective of its content. Since information and its intrinsic value are so sacred, we Kopimists recognize the following axioms:

<ol>
<li>Copying of information is ethically right.</li>
<li>Dissemination of information is ethically right.</li>
<li><em>Copymixing</em> is a sacred kind of copying, moreso than the perfect, digital copying, because it expands and enhances the existing wealth of information</li>
<li>Copying or remixing information communicated by another person is seen as an act of respect and a strong expression of acceptance and Kopimistic faith.</li>
<li>The internet is holy.</li>
</ol>

Members of Kopimism (Kopimists) and Church of Kopimism recognized religious representatives (Operators) dedicate their lives to living in accordance with these axioms. The only correct way for a Kopimist to list is through the sanctification of these religious foundations.

### Become an Op

An "Op" is our term for religous leader (think pastor, rabbi, etc), though we also use the word "Reverend" to avoid religious percicution from people who don't accept any religion that's built on principals other than those found in the old remixed texts of their religion (also sometimes "Reverend" is the only prefix we can find in web forms so that's what we have chosen). 

If you identify with Kopimism, and you wan to evangelize the movement we have room for you. Please email [teamcoltra@gmail.com](mailto:teamcoltra@gmail.com) with your name and city (and location if not in Idaho) and we will have you officially listed on this page. 

### Donate

We keep our costs pretty low but our domain costs $25 a year, and all the time I spend on the church is time that I am not working. Obviously the more that we get the better we can serve our community and provide better outreach. All your donations are tax deductable, if you need a letter from us please email [teamcoltra@gmail.com](mailto:teamcoltra@gmail.com) with your name and address and we will give you a tax receipt.

Please type in a donation amount (in dollars), $15 is appreciated. For every dollar we get we can buy 10 days of server time, or 200 leaflets we can use to spread the message of kopimism.

<input type="text" id="amount" value="15">
