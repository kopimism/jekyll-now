We keep our costs pretty low but our domain costs $25 a year, and all the time I spend on the church is time that I am not working. Obviously the more that we get the better we can serve our community and provide better outreach. All your donations are tax deductable, if you need a letter from us please email [teamcoltra@gmail.com](mailto:teamcoltra@gmail.com) with your name and address and we will give you a tax receipt.

Please type in a donation amount (in US dollars), $15 is appreciated. For every dollar we get we can buy 10 days of server time, or 200 leaflets we can use to spread the message of kopimism.

<i>The Kopimist Church (of Idaho Inc.) is a US non-profit 501(c)3 organization, the Kopimist Church of Canada our Canadian arm is also a Federally registered non-profit but does not yet have charity status. Donations will be made in US dollars and distributed between churches as needed.</i>
